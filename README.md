# Neural_Network_CPP
Implementing a neural network on CPP

- The data used is the wheat seeds data found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds)
- Solves a classification problem.
- Uses back propagation to train the network.
- Classes are defined for each of the network, the layer and the neurons.


## To Run

```
g++ -o exec NeuralNetwork.cc main.cc && ./exec
```
